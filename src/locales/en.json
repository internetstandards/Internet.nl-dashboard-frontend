In many cases these modifications are harmless. Examples are whitespace replacement and header field line rewrapping. If you are a DKIM signing sender then you can choose whether or not to tolerate these types of changes, both for the header and the body of emails. The <code>simple</code> setting tolerates almost no modifications, and <code>relaxed</code> tolerates common modifications. If no setting is specified it defaults to <code>simple</code> for both header and body. In particular, header modifications are a common cause of a DKIM signature unintentionally becoming invalid, thus hindering deliverability. Using <code>relaxed</code> for the header while keeping <code>simple</code> for the body (<code>c=relaxed/simple</code>), can mitigate these kind of issues.</li><li>For a \"good practice on domains without mail\" see the <a href=\"#control-panel-9\">explanation of the \"DMARC policy\" subtest</a>.</li></ul>",

This can speed up the fixing of found vulnerabilities, reducing the opportunity for malicious parties to exploit. </p><p>The syntax of the file is intended to be machine- and human-readable.
